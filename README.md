# CS412--Machine-Learning
 Goal of this project is to develop high performance classifiers for identifying American Sign Language.
# 1 Dataset
The data set is a collection of images of characters from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.
Download the dataset from the link. The training data set contains 29,000 images which are 200x200 pixels.
You will be provided with two test sets. The first test set, which is already available for download, contains 7250 images in the same format as the training data.
On June 7, 2021, you will be provided with the second test set. You will run your models over this test set as well and submit your prediction results to SUCourse. This test set will be in the same format as the first test set.
For both test sets only the input images will be shared, the gold standard labels will not be shared.
We have setup a Kaggle competition for this task at the following link link.. You should submit your first test set results to this kaggle page to appear in the public leader board.
